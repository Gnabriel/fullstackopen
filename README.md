# [Full Stack Open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

This course is held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.

It serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST/GraphQL APIs built with Node.js.

Other topics that this course covers is testing, configuration & environment management, TypeScript, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data. This repository contains my solutions for some of this course's exercises that I found extra interesting.
